# piksel-akademi-html-css-template
🎨 I've designed & developed Piksel Akademi's website when I was a student of Piksel Akademi to improve my web design & development skills. First, I designed this theme in Photoshop and then convert it into HTML and CSS using the Bootstrap to be mobile friendly. In some parts of the theme, I used various JavaScript plugins.
